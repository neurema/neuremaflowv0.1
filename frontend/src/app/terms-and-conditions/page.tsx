            Depending on your region, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>Consent (e.g., parental/guardian consent for child accounts; optional analytics preferences)</li>

            5) Children’s privacy and consent (all ages supported)
          </h2>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Neurema is designed for learners of all ages. Where required by local
            law, children and minors must use Neurema with verifiable
            parental/guardian consent or through their school/institution.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.subHeading}>5.1 Parental consent workflow (how we verify)</h3>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            At sign-up (or when an account is created by a school), we use one of
            the following lawful methods:
          </p>
          <ol className={styles.orderedList}>
            <li>
              Parent/guardian email link: A consent link is sent to the parent/guardian
              email. Consent is recorded upon confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
              One-time code: A code is sent via email/SMS to a verified
              parent/guardian contact and must be entered to activate the account.
            </li>
            <li>
              School-managed consent: A school/organization may create student
              accounts under a roster, confirming it has obtained all required
              consents and notices from parents/guardians.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            We may ask for minimal information to verify the requester’s identity and
            relationship to the child. If consent is not provided within a reasonable
            time, the account may be limited or deleted.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.subHeading}>5.2 Parent/guardian rights</h3>
          <p className={styles.paragraph}>
            Parents/guardians can review, correct, or request deletion of a child’s
            personal data processed for the Services and withdraw consent at any time
            by emailing neurema.in@gmail.com. We will respond within applicable legal
            timeframes and may need to verify identity.
          </p>
          <h3 className={styles.subHeading}>5.3 Additional protections for children</h3>
          <ul className={styles.list}>
            <li>We do not use children’s data for targeted advertising.</li>
            <li>We do not sell children’s personal data.</li>

            We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal data (e.g., encryption in transit, access controls, logging, least-privilege practices). No system is perfectly secure, so we encourage you to keep your credentials safe and notify us of any suspected issues.
